---

Facet that provides a list of entries of ranges where each distance range has a number of hits associated. Great for finding results which are near to you.

#### Elasticsearch Mapping

Below is an example mapping for the field `metascore`. We need to use a numeric type field type for this facet.

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "location": {
      "type": "geo_point"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Usage

```javascript
{
  MultiQueryOptionsFacet
} from '@searchkit/sdk'

const searchkitConfig = {
  ...
  facets: [
    // example of Numeric Range
    new GeoDistanceOptionsFacet({
      field: 'location',
      origin: '37.7749, -122.4194',
      unit: 'mi',
      ranges: [
        { to: 10, label: 'Very Close' },
        { from: 10, to: 20, label: 'Car ride away' },
        { from: 20, to: 100, label: 'A little far' }
      ],
      label: 'location',
      identifier: 'location'
    })
  ]
}

const request = Searchkit(searchkitConfig);
const response = await request
  .setFilters([
    {
      identifier: 'location',
      value: 'Very Close'
    }
  ])
  .execute({
    facets: true,
    hits: {
      size: 10,
      from: 0,
    },
  });
```
