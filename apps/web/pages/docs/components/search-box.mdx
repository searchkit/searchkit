# Search Box

The search box widget is used to let the user perform a text-based query.

## Searchkit Setup

Configure the `search_attributes` to include the fields you want to search on.

he search attributes define what Elasticsearch fields should be searched when a user performs a search.

The search attributes can be configured as follows:

```js
{ 
  search_settings: {
    search_attributes: [
      "description", 
      "actors", 
      { field: "title", weight: 3 }, 
      "released.year"
    ]
  }
}
```

The following configuration will search the `description`, `actors` and an object field `released.year` fields with the default weight of 1. The `title` field will be weighted 3 times more than the `actors` field.

### Overriding the default organic query handler

Out the box, Searchkit provides a Elasticsearch query that is designed to work well for most search use cases. However, you may want to customise the query to improve the relevance of the search results.

This example shows how to use the `getQuery` function to customise the query for a given request.

Below is an example of using the [`combined_fields` query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-combined-fields-query.html) instead.

```js
const results = await apiClient.handleRequest(req.body, {
  getQuery: (query, search_attributes) => {
    return [
      {
        combined_fields: {
          query,
          fields: search_attributes,
        },
      },
    ];
  },
});
```

## Usage

### Basic

```jsx
import { InstantSearch, SearchBox } from 'react-instantsearch-hooks-web';

export function App() {
  return (
    <InstantSearch indexName="instant_search" searchClient={searchClient}>
      <SearchBox />
    </InstantSearch>
  );
}
```
