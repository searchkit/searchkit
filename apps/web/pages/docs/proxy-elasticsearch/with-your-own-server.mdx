Continue to generate Elasticsearch queries from the browser with Searchkit but proxy the request through your own application server. This is useful if you want to add additional security (add Elasticsearch credentials or restrict data with additional filters) or logging to your Elasticsearch queries.

## Change the request to my own API

Implement your own API route on your application server by creating a POST `/_msearch` API and specify your application server in the `host` property or building a [custom transporter](/docs/guides/setup-elasticsearch#custom-transport). Searchkit will make requests to the proxy which will then relay the request to Elasticsearch with read only security credentials and extra filtering restrictions (if needed).  

## Customise the network request

You can customise the network request by creating a custom transporter. This is useful if you want to add additional headers or modify the request before it is sent to Elasticsearch. 

see [Custom Transporter](/docs/api-documentation/searchkit#custom-transporter)
