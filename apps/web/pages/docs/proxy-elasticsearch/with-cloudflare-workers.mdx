# Proxy With Cloudflare Workers

For production use, we dont recommend calling Elasticsearch directly from the browser. Thankfully, Searchkit provides a way to proxy the search request through to a node API. This is really easy to setup.

Below this creates an API which transforms the instantsearch requests sent from the browser into Elasticsearch queries and transforms the responses into instantsearch results.

## Get Started with Cloudflare Workers

Follow the guide [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/) to get started with Cloudflare Workers.

## Checkout example project

You 

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/searchkit/searchkit/tar.gz/main | \
tar -xz --strip=2 searchkit-main/examples/with-cloudflare-workers
```

or view the example codebase on github [here](https://github.com/searchkit/searchkit/tree/main/examples/with-cloudflare-workers)

## Create a new project

```bash
npx wrangler init my-searchkit-proxy-api
cd my-searchkit-proxy-api
```

## Install @searchkit/api and searchkit

```bash
yarn add @searchkit/api searchkit
```

## Update the Cloudflare worker

Edit the `src/index.js` file to look like this, replacing the `connection` and `search_settings` with your own. 

```ts
import Client from "@searchkit/api";
 
const client = Client({
  connection: {
    host: "<ELASTICSEARCH_URL>",
    // if you are authenticating with api key
    // https://www.searchkit.co/docs/guides/setup-elasticsearch#connecting-with-api-key
    // apiKey: '###'
    // if you are authenticating with username/password
    // https://www.searchkit.co/docs/guides/setup-elasticsearch#connecting-with-usernamepassword
    // auth: {
    //   username: "elastic",
    //   password: "changeme"
    // },
  },
  search_settings: {
    highlight_attributes: ["highlightField1", "highlightField2"],
    search_attributes: ["title", "description"],
    result_attributes: ["title", "description"],
    facet_attributes: [
      "type",
      { attribute: "actors", field: "actors.keyword" },
    ],
  },
});
 
// Handle CORS preflight requests
async function handleOptions(request: Request) {
  return new Response(null, {
    headers: {
      "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
      "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, POST, OPTIONS",
      "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
    },
  });
}
 
async function handleRequest(event: FetchEvent) {
  if (event.request.method === "OPTIONS") {
    // Handle CORS preflight requests
    return handleOptions(event.request);
  }
 
  const body = await event.request.json();
  const results = await client.handleRequest(body);
 
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(results), {
    headers: {
      "content-type": "application/json",
      "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
      "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS",
      "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
    },
  });
}
 
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  return event.respondWith(handleRequest(event));
});
```

then run your worker locally

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

## Update the Searchkit client on frontend

and then we update the instantsearch client to use the API.

The searchkit configuration and import are no longer needed. Rather than the elasticsearch requests being generated and performed on the browser, the search state is instead sent to the API, which then generates and performs requests to Elasticsearch on the server. 

```ts {3,5}
const searchClient = instantsearch({
  indexName: "imdb_movies",
  searchClient: SearchkitInstantsearchClient({
    url: "http://localhost:8787/",
  }),
});

```

## Production

When you are ready to deploy to production, run

```bash
npx wrangler publish
```

and then update the url in the frontend to point to the new url.

And that's it! You dont need to worry about the security of your Elasticsearch cluster, and you can scale your API independently of your search cluster.
