### SearchkitConfig

#### `connection` configuration

- `host` - Elasticsearch url host
- `apiKey` - Elasticsearch API key. This is optional but strongly recommended for production environments. You can create an API key via [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/master/api-keys.html).
- `headers` - Additional headers to pass to Elasticsearch. This is optional.
- `auth` - Basic auth credentials. This is optional.

See [connecting to Elasticsearch](/docs/guides/setup-elasticsearch) for more information on setting up Elasticsearch.

Connection also supports implementing your own connector to Elasticsearch. You can do this by passing in a transporter instance through `connection`.

You can use this for more complex authentication connections with Elasticsearch or Opensearch.


```ts

import { ESTransporter } from 'searchkit'
import type { SearchRequest } from "searchkit"

class MyTransporter extends ESTransporter {
  async performNetworkRequest(requests: SearchRequest[]) {
    // you can use any http client here
    return fetch(`https://localhost:9200/_msearch`, {
      headers: {
        // Add custom headers here
      },
      body: this.createElasticsearchQueryFromRequest(requests),
      method: 'POST'
    })
  }
}

// then pass the custom transporter to the client
const client = Client({
  connection: new MyTransporter()
});
```

#### `search_settings` configuration

```tsx
search_settings: {
  highlight_attributes: ["title", "actors"],
  search_attributes: ["title^3", "actors"],
  result_attributes: ["title", "actors", "poster", "year"],
  facet_attributes: [
    "type",
    { attribute: "actors", field: "actors.keyword" },
    "rated",
    { attribute: "imdbrating", type: "numeric" },
    { attribute: "metascore", type: "numeric" },
  ],
  filter_attributes: [
    { attribute: "year", type: "numeric" }
  ],
  sorting: {
    default: {
      field: '_score',
      order: 'desc'
    },
    _year_desc: [{
      field: 'year',
      order: 'desc'
    }]
  },
  geo_attribute: "location"
},
```

Attributes that are used to configure the search experience.

- `highlight_attributes` - Attributes that are used to highlight the search results.
- `search_attributes` - Attributes that are used to search the results.
- `result_attributes` - Attributes that are returned in the search result response.
- `facet_attributes` - Attributes that are used to create facets. Facets can be of type `string` or `numeric` or `date`.
- `filter_attributes` - Attributes that are used to create filters. Filters can be of type `string` or `numeric` or `date`.
- `sorting` - Attributes that are used to create sorting options. Sorting can be a single sorting field or multiple.
- `query_rules` - Rules that affect search relevance. See [Query Rules](/docs//query-rules) for more information.
- `geo_attribute` - Attribute that is used for geo based searches.

##### search_attributes

The search attributes define what Elasticsearch fields should be searched when a user performs a search.

The search attributes can be configured as follows:

```js
search_attributes: [
  "description", 
  "actors", 
  { field: "title", weight: 3 }, 
  "released.year"
];
```

The following configuration will search the `description`, `actors` and an object field `released.year` fields with the default weight of 1. The `title` field will be weighted 3 times more than the `actors` field.

##### `facet_attributes`

For **text** based facets, you need to specify a `keyword` type field to use for the facet. This is because Elasticsearch does not support aggregations on text fields. You can find more information about the field mapping [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-get-field-mapping.html).

Typically you would create a subfield of the text field with the `keyword` type. For example, if you have a `actors` field with the `text` type, you would create a `actors.keyword` field with the `keyword` type.

```tsx
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "actors": {
        "type": "text",
        "fields": {
          "keyword": {
            "type": "keyword",
            "ignore_above": 256
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

in the above example, you would specify the `actors` facet as follows:

```tsx
facet_attributes: [
  { attribute: "actors", field: "actors.keyword" },
],
```

and you would use the `actors` attribute within the UI components.

Below is an example of a `RefinementList` Instantsearch React component that uses the `actors` facet.

```tsx
<RefinementList attribute="actors" searchable={true} limit={10} />
```

See [facets guide](/docs/guides/facets) for more information.

###### numeric and date types

For range based facets, you need to specify the `type` as `numeric` or `date`. This is so the client can correctly generate facet stats for the field to be used in the UI.

```tsx
facet_attributes: [
  { attribute: "imdbrating", type: "numeric" },
  { attribute: "metascore", type: "numeric" },
],
```

Below is an example of a `NumericMenu` Instantsearch React component that uses the `imdbrating` facet.

```tsx
<NumericMenu
  attribute="imdbrating"
  items={[
    { label: "5 - 7", start: 5, end: 7 },
    { label: "7 - 9", start: 7, end: 9 },
    { label: ">= 9", start: 9 },
  ]}
/>
```

##### `sorting` 

Sorting can be configured as follows:

```tsx

sorting: {
  default: {
    field: '_score',
    order: 'desc'
  },
  _year_desc: [{
    field: 'year',
    order: 'desc'
  }]
}
```

The `default` sorting option is used when no sorting option is selected. The `_year_desc` sorting option is used when the user selects the `_year_desc` sorting option.

The sorting option can be a single sorting field or multiple sorting fields.

See the [sorting guide](/docs/guides/sorting) for more information.

##### `geo_attribute`

The `geo_attribute` is used to configure the geo based search experience. The `geo_attribute` must point to a `geo_point` or `geo_shape` field type in Elasticsearch.

```tsx
geo_attribute: "location"
```

See [Geo Search](/docs/guides/geo-search) for more information.

### Request Options

`RequestOptions` is an object that contains the following properties:

  - **getQuery** - The function used to override the default Elasticsearch query.
  - **getBaseFilters** - The function used to provide the base Elasticsearch filters. These filters are applied to all search requests.
  - **hooks** - The hooks object containing the following properties:
    - **beforeSearch** - The function that is invoked before the search request is executed.
    - **afterSearch** - The function that is invoked after the search response is received.  

#### `getQuery` optional function

The `getQuery` function is used to override the default Elasticsearch query. The function must return an Elasticsearch query. You can read more about the Elasticsearch query DSL [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html).

Below is an example of a `getQuery` function that overrides the default query to use the `combined_fields` query type (read more about `combined_fields` [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-combined-fields-query.html)).

To see the full Elasticsearch query that is executed to Elasticsearch, you can run the client in debug mode (see below).

```tsx
  const results = await client.handleRequest(req.body, {
    getQuery: (query, search_attributes) => {
      return [
        {
          combined_fields: {
            query,
            fields: search_attributes,
          },
        },
      ];
    }
  });
```

##### Function Parameters

- **query**: The query string from the search request.
- **search_attributes**: The search attributes from the search configuration.

#### `getBaseFilters` optional function

The `getBaseFilters` function is used to add filters to the Elasticsearch query. The function must return an Elasticsearch query. You can read more about the Elasticsearch query DSL [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html).

This function is useful if the request needs to be filtered based on the user's session. For example, if you want to filter the search results based on the user's role or status.

Below is an example of a `getBaseFilters` function that adds a filter to the Elasticsearch query to only return results where the `status` field is `published`.

To see the full Elasticsearch query that is executed to Elasticsearch, you can run the client in debug mode (see below).

```ts
  const results = await client.handleRequest(req.body, {
    getBaseFilters: () => {
      return [
        {
          bool: {
            must: {
              term: {
                status: {
                  value: "published",
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      ];
    }
  });
```

### RequestOptions Hooks

Hooks are functions that are invoked at different stages of the search request. Hooks are useful if you want to perform some action before or after the search request is executed.

#### `beforeSearch` hook function

The `beforeSearch` hook is invoked before the search request is executed. This hook is useful if you want to perform some action before the search request is executed.

Examples include:
- Learn to rank
- Semantic search
- A/B testing

Below is an example of a `beforeSearch` hook that adds a `rescore` query to the Elasticsearch query.

To see the full Elasticsearch query that is executed to Elasticsearch, you can run the client in debug mode (see below).

```ts
  const results = await client.handleRequest(req.body, {
    hooks: {
      beforeSearch: (searchRequests) => {
        const uiRequest = searchRequests[0]

        return [
          {
            ...uiRequest,
            rescore: {
              window_size: 100,
              query: {
                rescore_query: {
                  match: {
                    plot: {
                      query: uiRequest.query,
                      operator: "and",
                    },
                  },
                },
                query_weight: 1,
                rescore_query_weight: 10,
              }
            }
          },
          searchRequests.slice(1, searchRequests.length)
        ]
        
      },
    }
  });
```

##### Function Parameters

- **searchRequests** - An array of `SearchRequest` objects. Each `SearchRequest` object contains the following properties:
  - **indexName** - The Elasticsearch index name.
  - **body** - The Elasticsearch request body query.
  - **request** - The state requested from the UI. Contains attributes like query, filters, sort, size and more.

#### `afterSearch` hook function

The `afterSearch` hook is invoked after the search response is received. This hook is useful if you want to perform some action after the search response is received.

Examples include:
- Logging
- Analytics

Below is an example of an `afterSearch` hook that logs the search response to the console.

```ts
  const results = await client.handleRequest(req.body, {
    hooks: {
      afterSearch: (searchRequests, searchResponses) => {
        console.log(searchResponses);
        return searchResponses;
      },
    },
  });
```

### Debug mode

The client can be run in debug mode to help with debugging the Elasticsearch query. To run the client in debug mode, set the `debug` flag to `true` in the `Client` function.

This is helpful when you're overriding the query via `getQuery` or providing base filters via `getBaseFilters` and want to see the Elasticsearch query that is executed to Elasticsearch.

```ts
const client = Client({
  // search_settings configuration
  connection: {
    // ...
  },
  search_settings: {
    search_attributes: ["title", "plot"],
    // ...
  }
}, { debug: true });
```

When the client is run in debug mode, the Elasticsearch query is logged to the console.
