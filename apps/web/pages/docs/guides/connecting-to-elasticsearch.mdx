title: Connecting to Elasticsearch
---

The easiest way to connect to Elasticsearch is to use Elastic cloud. You can sign up for a free trial account and get started right away.

### Connecting to Elastic Cloud

To connect to Elastic Cloud, you need to create an account and get your credentials. You can do this by following the instructions on the [Elastic Cloud website](https://www.elastic.co/cloud).

Once you have setup a deployment, do the following:

1. Go to the [Elastic Cloud console](https://cloud.elastic.co/).
2. Click on the deployment you want to connect to.
3. Locate the Elasticsearch URL and copy it.
4. Paste the URL into the `connection.host` field in the configuration object, within the Node app.
5. Create an API key with `read` privileges for the index. Copy the API key and paste it into the `connection.apiKey` field in the configuration object, within the Node app. 

```ts
const client = Client({
  connection: {
    host: "ELASTICSEARCH_URL",
    apiKey: "API_KEY"
  }
})
```

If Searchkit cannot connect to Elasticsearch, it will throw an error. You should be able to see the error in the terminal running the node API.

### Connecting to Elasticsearch locally

If you want to run Elasticsearch locally, you can download and install it from the [Elastic website](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).

Once you have installed Elasticsearch, you can start it by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
elasticsearch
```

You can then connect to Elasticsearch by setting the `connection.host` field in the configuration object, within the Node app, to `http://localhost:9200`.

API Key is not required but its important you use one for production.

```ts
const client = Client({
  connection: {
    host: "http://localhost:9200"
  }
})
```

### Connecting to Opensearch

Searchkit does not provide out of the box support for Opensearch. However, you can connect to Opensearch by using a custom transport.

You can use this for more complex authentication connections with Elasticsearch or Opensearch.

You can find an example of a custom transport below.

```ts

import type { Transporter, SearchRequest, ElasticsearchResponseBody } from '@searchkit/api'

class MyTransporter {
  async msearch(
    requests: SearchRequest[]
  ): Promise<ElasticsearchResponseBody[]> {
    // Implement your own search logic here
    // Fetch is an example of calling an API.
    const username = 'master-user'
    const password = 'master-user-password'

    const response = await fetch(`https://domain-endpoint/_msearch`, {
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
        // Basic auth
        "Authorization", 'Basic ' + Buffer.from(username + ":" + password).toString('base64')
      },
      body: requests
        .reduce<string[]>(
          (sum, request) => [
            ...sum,
            JSON.stringify({ index: request.indexName }),
            "\n",
            JSON.stringify(request.body),
            "\n",
          ],
          []
        )
        .join(""),
      method: "POST",
    });

    const responses = await response.json();
    return responses.responses;
  }
}

const client = Client({
  connection: new MyTransporter(),
  ...
});
```
