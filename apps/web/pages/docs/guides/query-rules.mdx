# Query Rules

Query rules are a powerful feature that allows you to customize the behavior of the search experience. They are a set of conditions and consequent actions that are applied to search results. They are applied in the order they are defined in the dashboard.

Query rules are defined in the `search_settings` configuration under `query_rules`. The `query_rules` configuration is an array of query rule objects. Each query rule object has the following properties:

  * `id`: String. Required. The id of the query rule. This is used to identify the query rule.
  * `conditions`: An array of [conditions](#query-rule-conditions) that define the conditions that must be met for the query rule to be applied.
  * `actions`: An [action](#query-rule-actions) that defines the actions to be taken when the query rule is applied.

Below is an example of a query rule that will pin the document "tt0111161" to the top of the search results when the query starts with "star".

```json
{
  "search_settings": {
    "query_rules": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "conditions": [
          [
            {
              "context": "query",
              "match_type": "prefix",
              "value": "star"
            }
          ]
        ],
        "actions": [
          {
            "action": "PinnedResult",
            "documentIds": ["tt0111161"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Its important to note that query rules are applied in the order they are defined in the configuration. This means that if you have two query rules that both match a query, the first query rule will be applied first and the second query rule will be applied second. This can be useful if you want to apply a query rule that will override another query rule.
  
## Query Rule Conditions

Conditions are used to define the conditions that must be met for a query rule to be applied.

The following conditions are supported in Searchkit:

- [Query](/docs/guides/query-rules/conditions/query)
- [Context](/docs/guides/query-rules/conditions/context)
- [Filter](/docs/guides/query-rules/conditions/filters)

Below is an example where we have two **OR** conditions:
* The first **OR** condition has two **AND** conditions. Both the `context` & `query` condition must be met.
* The second **OR** condition has one **AND** condition. The `context` condition must be met.

Either of the **OR** conditions must be met for the query rule action to be applied.

```json
{
  "search_settings": {
    "query_rules": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "conditions": [
          [
            {
              "context": "query",
              "match_type": "prefix",
              "value": "star"
            },
            {
              "context": "context",
              "value": "test"
            }
          ],
          [
            {
              "context": "context",
              "value": "ecommerce"
            }
          ]
          ]
        ],
        "actions": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Query Rule Actions

Actions are used to define the actions to be taken when a query rule is applied. Actions are defined in the `actions` property of a query rule object. The `actions` property is an array of actions. The following actions are supported in Searchkit:

- [Facet Order](/docs/guides/query-rules/actions/facet-order)
- [Pin Results](/docs/guides/query-rules/actions/pin-result)
- [Render User Data](/docs/guides/query-rules/actions/render-user-data)
- [Query rewrite](/docs/guides/query-rules/actions/query-rewrite)
- [Query boost](/docs/guides/query-rules/actions/query-boost)
- [Query filter](/docs/guides/query-rules/actions/query-filter)

## Debugging Query Rules

If you are having issues with your query rules, you can find what query rules are being applied to your search request in the search response via `appliedRules`. The `appliedRules` property is an array of query rule ids that were applied to the search request. The `appliedRules` property will be empty if no query rules were applied to the search request.
