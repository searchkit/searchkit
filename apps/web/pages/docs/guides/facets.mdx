Facets are used to filter search results by a specific field value. For example, you can use facets to filter search results by category, price, or brand.

## Facet types

There are two types of facets:

### String Based Facets
These facets are used to filter search results by a string field value. For example, you can use a string based facet to filter search results by category, brand, or color.

You can read more about string based facets in the [String Based Facets](/docs/guides/facets/string-based-facets) guide.

### Numeric based Facets
These facets are used to filter search results by a numeric field value. For example, you can use a range based facet to filter search results by price or rating.

You can read more about string based facets in the [String Based Facets](/docs/guides/facets/string-based-facets) guide.

## Filtering

Facet attributes can also be used to filter search results. For example, you can use a facet attribute in `filters`.

```jsx
<InstantSearch indexName="imdb_movies" searchClient={searchClient}>
  <Configure filters="price:[* TO 90]" />
  <NumericMenu attribute="price" />
</InstantSearch>
```

Read more about filtering in the [Filtering](/docs/guides/applying-filters) guide.

## Facet Ordering and Display

With the `DynamicWidgets` widget, you can order and conditionally display facets based on query rules. For example, you can display a facet based on a set of conditions.

For example, `brand` and `categories` are two facets being displayed. 

```jsx
<InstantSearch indexName="products" searchClient={searchClient}>
  <DynamicWidgets>
    <RefinementList attribute="brand" />
    <RefinementList attribute="categories" />
  </DynamicWidgets>
</InstantSearch>
```

You want to hide the `categories` facet only when the search user types in `star` in the search box.

```json
{
  "search_settings": {
    "query_rules": [
      {
        "conditions": [
          [
            {
              "context": "query",
              "match_type": "prefix",
              "value": "star"
            }
          ]
        ],
        "actions": [
          {
            "action": "RenderFacetsOrder",
            "facetAttributesOrder": ["categories"] // only display categories facet
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

```
