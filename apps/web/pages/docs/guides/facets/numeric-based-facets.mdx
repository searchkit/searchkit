Searchkit API supports a number of different instantsearch facet components. The following examples show what components are supported and how to add them to your search application.

Below we will show how to setup a field in Elasticsearch to be used as a facet attribute. You will then be able to use the facet attribute with instantsearch components.

### Defining a facet attribute

By default, any numeric type field in Elasticsearch will be defined as a numeric type field. the numeric type field is can be used for aggregations.

Read more about Elasticsearch dynamic field mapping in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/dynamic-field-mapping.html).

The following document indexed in Elasticsearch:

```json
{
  "price": 90
}
```

Will result in the following mapping

```json
{
  "price": {
    "type": "long"
  }
}
```

The field can be used for facet attributes. In this case, the facet field should be `price`.

```json
{
  "facet_attributes": [{ "attribute": "price", "type": "numeric", "field": "price" }]
}
```

We need to define the field type as `numeric` as some of the instantsearch components require stats about the field. With the field type defined as `numeric`, we generate stats about the field for the instantsearch components.

Then you can use instantsearch components using the `price` facet attribute.

# Instantsearch Components

See the [Refinement Facets](/docs/components/refinements/refinement-list) components on how to use.
