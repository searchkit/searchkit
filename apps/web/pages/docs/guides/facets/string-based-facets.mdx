Searchkit API supports a number of different instantsearch facet components. The following examples show what components are supported and how to add them to your search application.

Below we will show how to setup a field in Elasticsearch to be used as a facet attribute. You will then be able to use the facet attribute with instantsearch components.

### Defining a facet attribute

By default, any string type field in Elasticsearch will be defined as a text field and a keyword subfield. The text field is used for full text search and the keyword field is used for aggregations.

Read more about Elasticsearch dynamic field mapping in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/dynamic-field-mapping.html).

The following document indexed in Elasticsearch:

```json
{
  "brand": "Apple"
}
```

will result in the following mapping:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "brand": {
      "type": "text",
      "fields": {
        "keyword": {
          "type": "keyword"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

 The keyword field is the field that should be used for facet attributes. In this case, the facet field should be `brand.keyword`.

 You will then be able to define a facet attribute in Searchkit:

### Simple Facet Attribute

```ts
{
  facet_attributes: [
    { 
      attribute: 'brand', 
      field: 'brand.keyword', 
      type: 'string' 
    },
  ]
}

```

### Frontend Usage

Then you can use instantsearch components using the `brand` facet attribute.

```jsx filename="pages/search.tsx"
import { RefinementList } from "react-instantsearch-dom";

<RefinementList attribute="brand" />;
```

## Array based Values

Elasticsearch supports array based values. This means that you can have a field that is an array of values.

Read more about array based values in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/array.html).

### Defining a facet attribute for an array field

An example of an array field is a `tags` field. The following document indexed in Elasticsearch:

```json
{
  "tags": ["apple", "fruit"]
}
```

will result in the following mapping:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "tags": {
      "type": "text",
      "fields": {
        "keyword": {
          "type": "keyword"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The keyword field is the field that should be used for facet attributes. In this case, the facet field should be `tags.keyword`.

You will then be able to define a facet attribute in Searchkit:

```ts
{
  facet_attributes: [
    { 
      attribute: 'tags', 
      field: 'tags.keyword', 
      type: 'string' 
    },
  ]
}

```

Then you can use instantsearch components using the `tags` facet attribute.

## Nested Fields Support

Elasticsearch supports nested fields. This means that you can have a field that is an object with nested fields.

Read more about nested fields in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/nested.html).

### Marketplace Example

A product document may have one or more suppliers. Each supplier may have a different price for the product. The following document shows a product with two suppliers:

```json
{
  "name": "AirPods",
  "marketplace": [
    {
      "supplier": "Apple",
      "price": 100,
      "market": "Worldwide"
    },
    {
      "supplier": "Dixons",
      "price": 95,
      "market": "GB"
    }
  ]
}
```

The mapping for the `marketplace` field would be:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "marketplace": {
      "type": "nested",
      "properties": {
        "supplier": {
          "type": "text",
          "fields": {
            "keyword": {
              "type": "keyword"
            }
          }
        },
        "price": {
          "type": "integer"
        },
        "market": {
          "type": "text",
          "fields": {
            "keyword": {
              "type": "keyword"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Defining a facet attribute for a nested field

To define a facet attribute for a nested field, you need to specify the path to the nested field.

```ts
{
  facet_attributes: [
    { 
      attribute: 'marketplace.supplier', 
      field: 'supplier.keyword', 
      type: 'string',
      nestedPath: 'marketplace'
    },
  ]
}

```

Then you can use instantsearch components using the `marketplace.supplier` facet attribute.
