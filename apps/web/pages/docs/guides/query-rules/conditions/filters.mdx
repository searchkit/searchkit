description: Apply a Filter Present condition rule 
---

The `filterPresent` condition is used to apply actions where there are particular filters in the `facetfilters`. The `filterPresent` condition has the following properties:

  * `context`: The context of the condition. This must be set to `filterPresent`.
  * `values`: An array of `attribute:value` facet filters to match against. The `attribute` must be the name of the facet and the `value` must be the value of the facet.

Below is an example of the `facet_filters` condition where we are matching against the `type` facet with the value `movie`:

```json
{
  "search_settings": {
    "query_rules": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "conditions": [
          [
            {
              "context": "filterPresent",
              "values": [{ "attribute": "type", "value": "movie" }]
            }
          ]
        ],
        "actions": [
          // actions that will apply for conditions
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Below is an example of the `facet_filters` condition where we are matching against the `type` facet with the value `movie` and the `genre` facet with the value `drama`. Both the `type` and `genre` facet filters must be present for the query rule to be applied.

```json
{
  "search_settings": {
    "query_rules": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "conditions": [
          [
            {
              "context": "filterPresent",
              "values": [
                { "attribute": "type", "value": "movie" }, 
                { "attribute": "genre", "value": "drama" }
              ]
            }
          ]
        ],
        "actions": [
          // actions that will apply for conditions
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
