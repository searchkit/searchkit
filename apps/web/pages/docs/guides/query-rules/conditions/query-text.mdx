description: Apply a query condition rule 
---

The `Query` condition is used to match the query string. The `Query` condition has the following properties:

  * `context`: The context of the condition. This must be set to `query`.
  * `match_type`: The type of match to perform. This can be set to `exact`, `prefix` or `contains`.
  * `value`: The value to match against.

Below is an example of the `query` condition which will apply the actions when the `query` has a prefix of "star". 

```json
{
  "search_settings": {
    "query_rules": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "conditions": [
          [
            {
              "context": "query",
              "match_type": "prefix",
              "value": "star"
            }
          ]
        ],
        "actions": [
          // actions that will apply for conditions
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
