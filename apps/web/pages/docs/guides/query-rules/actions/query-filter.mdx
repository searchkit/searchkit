description: Learn how to filter documents from your search results.

The `QueryFilter` action refines the search results using filters. This action is useful when you want to filter out documents that do not match a specific condition. For example, you can use this action to filter out documents that do not have a specific attribute value.

  * `action`: The action to perform. This must be set to `QueryFilter`.
  * `query`: A query string that will be used to match documents. This query string should use attributes from facet or filters attributes. 

Below is an example of the `QueryFilter` action:

```json
{
  search_settings: {
    facet_attributes: [
      'type',
      { field: 'actors.keyword', attribute: 'actors', type: 'string' },
      'rated'
    ],
    query_rules: [
      {
        id: '1',
        conditions: [
          [
            {
              context: 'query',
              match_type: 'exact',
              value: 'movie'
            }
          ]
        ],
        actions: [
          {
            action: 'QueryFilter',
            query: 'type:movie'
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
