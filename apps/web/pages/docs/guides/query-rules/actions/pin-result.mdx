### `PinnedResult` Rule Action

The `PinnedResult` action is used to pin a document to the top of the search results. 

The `PinnedResult` action has the following properties:

  * `action`: The action to perform. This must be set to `PinnedResult`.
  * `documentIds`: An array of document ids to pin to the top of the search results.

Below is an example of the `PinnedResult` action:
  
  ```json
  {
  "search_settings": {
    "query_rules": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "conditions": [
          [
            // conditions here
          ]
        ],
        "actions": [
          {
            "action": "PinnedResult",
            "documentIds": ["tt0111161"] // _id of the document to pin
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
