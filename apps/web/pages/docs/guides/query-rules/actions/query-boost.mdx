The `QueryBoost` action boosts the relevance of your search results. This action is useful when you want to boost the relevance of a specific documents which match a query.

  * `action`: The action to perform. This must be set to `QueryBoost`.
  * `query`: A query string that will be used to match documents. This query string should use attributes from facet or filters attributes. 

Below is an example of the `QueryBoost` action:

    ```json
  {
  "search_settings": {
    "query_rules": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "conditions": [
          [
            // conditions here
          ]
        ],
        "actions": [
            // for all documents that match the query, boost the relevance by 2 
            {
              "action": "QueryBoost",
              "query": 'actors:"Dan Aykroyd" OR actors:"Charlie Sheen"',
              "weight": 2
            },
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
