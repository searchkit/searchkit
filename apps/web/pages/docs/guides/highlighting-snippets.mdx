# Highlighting & Snippets

Highlighting is a way to highlight a specific part of a search result. It is useful when you want to show the user where the search term is located in the result.

## Differences between highlighting and snippets

Highlighting and snippets are very similar. The main difference is that highlighting is returns the whole field value, highlighting the matches while snippets returns a part of the field value, highlighting the matches.

Highlighting would be useful for short value fields like title.

Snippets would be useful for long value fields like description.

## Highlighting

First we need to add the `highlight_attributes` to the `search_settings` configuration.

```javascript

const searchSettings = {
  ...
    search_settings: {
      highlight_attributes: ['title']
    }
  ...
}
```

Then we can use the `Highlight` component to return the matches. 

```jsx

const hitView = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2><Highlight hit={props.hit} attribute="title" /></h2>
    </div>
  )
}

```

## Snippets

First we need to add the `snippet_attributes` to the `search_settings` configuration.

```javascript

const searchSettings = {
  ...
    search_settings: {
      snippet_attributes: ['description']
    }
  ...
}
```

Then we can use the `Snippet` component to return the matches. 

```jsx

import { Hits, Highlight } from "react-instantsearch-dom"

const hitView = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2><Highlight hit={props.hit} attribute="title" /></h2>
      <p><Snippet hit={props.hit} attribute="description" /></p>
    </div>
  )
}

```

## Troubleshooting

1. Make sure you have the `highlight_attributes` or `snippet_attributes` in the `search_settings` configuration.
2. Make sure the attributes are also specified in the search attributes too, and match the same name.
