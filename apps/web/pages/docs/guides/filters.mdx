# Filters

import { Tabs, Tab } from '../../../components/Tabs';

There are a number of ways to apply filters to your search results. Filters can be applied on:
- [client](#applying-filters-on-the-client) - Highlighting results on the client
- [server](#applying-filters-on-the-server) - Applying user level filtering 

## Applying Filters on the Client

Filters can be applied on the client by using the `filters` property on the `configure` component on Instantsearch.

### Setup

To apply filters on the client, you must first setup the filter in either the `facet_attributes` and `filter_attributes` configuration in your application settings.

Below is an example of a configuration that has a `facet_attributes` and `filter_attributes` setup.

```js
{
  facet_attributes: [
    { attribute: 'author', field: 'author.keyword', type: 'string' },
    { attribute: 'price', field: 'price', type: 'numeric' },
  ],
  filter_attributes: [
    { attribute: 'publisher', field: 'publisher.keyword', type: 'string' },
    { attribute: 'genre', field: 'genre.keyword', type: 'string' },
    { attribute: 'date', field: 'date.field', type: 'date' },
    { attribute: 'nestedField', field: 'price', type: 'string', nestedPath: 'nested' }
  ],
  result_attributes: [],
  search_attributes: []
}
```

<Tabs items={["React", "instantsearch.js"]}>
  <Tab> 
```jsx
import { Configure } from 'react-instantsearch-dom';

<Configure
  filters="price:[90 TO *]"
/>
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```js
instantsearch.widgets.configure({
  filters: "price:[90 TO *]"
});
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Filters can be applied on the client by using the `filters` property on the `configure` component on Instantsearch.

Use the `attribute` property to specify the field you want to filter on.

Nested fields are not supported in the `filters` property. To filter on nested fields, use `facetFilters` or `numericFilters` property.

### Filter Syntax

- [Filter by string](/docs/guides/filters/filter-by-string)
- [Filter by numeric value](/docs/guides/filters/filter-by-numeric-value)
- [Filter by date](/docs/guides/filters/filter-by-date)
- [Filter by boolean](/docs/guides/filters/filter-by-boolean)
- [Filter by array](/docs/guides/filters/filter-by-array)

### Numeric & Facet Filters

Numeric & Facet filters are typically used by widgets.

You can also add numeric filters or facet Filters to the search by using the `numericFilters` or `facetFilters` property on the `configure` component on Instantsearch.

<Tabs items={["React", "instantsearch.js"]}>
  <Tab> 
```jsx
import { Configure } from 'react-instantsearch-dom';

<Configure
  facetFilters={["author:John"]}
  numericFilters={["price>10", "price<20"]}
/>
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```js
instantsearch.widgets.configure({
  facetFilters: ["author:John"],
  numericFilters: ["price>10", "price<20"]
});
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Applying Filters on the Server

Filters can be applied on the server by using the `getBaseFilters` function within the `handleRequest` function.

Examples could include:
- Filtering out documents that are not published
- Filtering out documents that the user doesn't have access to

Below is an example of filtering documents that are not published.

Attributes cannot be used within `getBaseFilters` function. You must use the `field` property instead. This is because the `field` property is the actual field name in Elasticsearch.

The function must return an array of filters. Each filter is an object that follows the [Elasticsearch Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html).

Below is an example of filtering documents that are not published using the `status` field.

```js
const results = await apiClient.handleRequest(req.body, {
  getBaseFilters: () => {
    return [
      {
        bool: {
          must: {
            term: {
              status: "published",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    ];
  },
});
```
